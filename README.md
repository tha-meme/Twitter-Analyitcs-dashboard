# Twitter-Analyitcs-dashboard
In task 6 , I was not able to highlight days with significant spikes in media interactions in the same chart. So  built a new chart to highlight days with significant spikes in media interactions.


These were the tasks given


1) Create a clustered bar chart that breaks down the sum of URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks by
tweet category (e.g., tweets with media, tweets with links, tweets with hashtags). Only include tweets that
have at least one of these interaction types.
2) Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by the sum of retweets and likes. Filter out tweets posted on
weekends and show the user profile that posted each tweet.
3) Create a line chart showing the trend of the average engagement rate over each month of the year. Separate
the lines for tweets with media content and those without.
4) Develop a visualization that compares the number of replies, retweets, and likes for tweets that have received
media engagements greater than the median value. Include a filter for tweets posted in the last 3 months.
5) Analyse tweets to show a comparison of the engagement rate for tweets with app opens versus tweets without
app opens. Include only tweets posted between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays.
6) Create a dual-axis chart that shows the number of media views and media engagements by the day of the
week for the last quarter. Highlight days with significant spikes in media interactions.
7) Build a pie chart that represents the proportion of total clicks (URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks)
for tweets with more than 500 impressions. Include a drill-down to view the specific types of clicks for each
tweet.
